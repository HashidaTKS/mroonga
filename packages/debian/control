 Mroonga is a fast fulltext searchable storage engine for MySQL.
 It is based on groonga, a fast fulltext search engine and column store.
 Groonga is good at real time update.
 .
 This package provides a MySQL storage engine as a shared library.
 This provides "mroonga" storage engine. It means you can use
 "ENGINE = mroonga" in "CREATE TABLE". You can use
 "ENGINE = groonga" in "CREATE TABLE" with mysql-server-mroonga-compatible
 package. It provides "groonga" storage engine. But "groonga" storage engine
 is deprecated. We recommend that you use "mroonga" storage engine
 rather than "groonga" storage engine.
